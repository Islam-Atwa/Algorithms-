// What is algorithms ?
    //Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing a task

/*

How Algorithms work ?
    Algorithms typically follow a logical structure:

    Input: The algorithm receives input data.
    Processing: The algorithm performs a series of operations on the input data.
    Output: The algorithm produces the desired output.

خواص الخوارزميات ؟ 
    
    - Clear and Unambiguous
    - Well-defined Inputs
    - Well defined Outputs
    - Finiteness: The algorithm must be finite, i.e. it should terminate after a finite time.
    -The algorithm must be simple, generic, and practical, 
    such that it can be executed using reasonable constraints and resources.

    -  must be just plain instructions that can be implemented in any language,
        and yet the output will be the same, as expected.

Why Wee need algorithms ?

    - Solving Proplem 
    - Optimizing solution 
    - Automating tasks: Algorithms can automate repetitive or complex tasks, saving time and effort.
